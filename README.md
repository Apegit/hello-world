I'm learning to use GitHub with the  Hello-Word-Tutorial

Hi, im interested in learning how to code (assembler/c/...) and scripts (ahk/lisp/vba/...) and heard a lot about github and how it brings programmers together. It looks like a useful tool, which I want to know sooner than later to maximise my improvment. Even if i see myself as an autodidact I see the advantages a globally accepted central collaborative code source, to find code-examples or maybe get help by philantrophic users. Maybe there will be the day that I myself will get philantrophic with my time and help other users but I wouldn't count on it. Thats me being honest thanking you for your interest.
